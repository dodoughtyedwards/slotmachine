# SimplifiedSlotMachine

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for the Simplified Slot Machine!

To configure the slot machine you'll find the settings outlined in appsettings.config. The configuration there is designed to be mapped to the objects in the Configuration folder of the SimplifiedSlotMachine project.

By default it is set to the configuration defined in the brief, but should handle a variety of different settings.
NOTE: I have not added the neccessary validation to ensure that all PercentageChanceToAppear values add up to 100. Incorrectly configuring this will result in undesirable behaviour.

I've included some tests, they are by no means extensive, but aim to serve as a demonstration of testability.

I hope that this will generate some interesting discussion points if you choose to invite me to an interview.
